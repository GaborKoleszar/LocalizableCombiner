### An iOS Localizable.strings combine

- Paste an absolute path for a localizable.strings file (first line) to add resources into.
- Second line is for the path for a localizable.strings file, from which you want to add resources into the first file (not overriding duplicates, only adding lines with new keys).
- Third line is the output file path (and name).
